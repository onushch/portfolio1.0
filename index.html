            Hi! I’m Illia — a passionate Frontend Developer who loves turning
            ideas into clean, modern and intuitive digital experiences. I focus
            on building interfaces that feel smooth, responsive and effortless
            for users, while keeping the codebase structured and maintainable.
            <br />

            I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including
            DOM manipulation, event handling, modular components and responsive
            layouts. I confidently work with tools such as Bootstrap, Gulp, Git,
            and GitHub, and I enjoy shaping projects from the ground up — from
            structuring files and planning UI logic to polishing the final
            interactions.<br />

            My workflow usually includes writing reusable components, improving
            performance, implementing accessible design patterns, and carrying
            out basic testing to ensure stability across devices and browsers.
            I’m constantly learning, exploring new technologies, and expanding
            my skill set to deliver projects that are both visually appealing
            and technically reliable.<br />

            What drives me the most is the ability to create interfaces that not
            only look great but also feel natural and intuitive — interfaces
            that users actually enjoy interacting with.<br />

        <h3>My bio</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Illya Onushchuk, a 21-year-old Frontend Developer
          originally from Ukraine and currently living in Spain. My journey into
          tech began long before I wrote my first line of code — it started with
          discipline, creativity, and a decade of professional dance training.
          That experience shaped my sense of aesthetics, structure, and
          precision, all of which naturally transitioned into my work as a
          developer. <br /><br />

          Today, I focus on building clean, modern, and user-friendly interfaces
          using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and tools like Bootstrap, Gulp, Git, and
          GitHub. I’m confident working with DOM interactions, responsive
          layouts, modular components and UI behavior based on real user
          experience. I approach every project with the same mindset: clarity,
          functionality, and a touch of creativity.<br /><br />

          I’m currently completing a 7-month Frontend Development program at
          GoIT Academy, where I continue to deepen my understanding of
          JavaScript, React, and related technologies. Beyond coursework, I
          develop personal projects — including a landing page for a dance
          studio and the concept of NFTGO, a mobile geolocation game combining
          NFTs, gamification and real-world exploration.<br /><br />

          Living in Spain has expanded my world both personally and
          professionally. I communicate confidently in English, and I’m actively
          learning Spanish, which helps me integrate into the culture and
          broaden my opportunities in the European tech environment.<br /><br />

          I’m an entrepreneur as well, managing my own business since a young
          age. This gives me a strong sense of responsibility, independence, and
          the ability to work consistently toward long-term goals.<br /><br />

          What motivates me most is growth — learning new tools, improving my
          craft, and building products that feel natural, intuitive, and
          enjoyable to use. I treat every project as a chance to turn an idea
          into something real, something people can interact with.<br /><br />
